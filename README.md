# eSALN-application

eSALN is a Java application for managing SALN information, leveraging DBMS for effective data handling. This repository includes GUI and database integration for streamlined SALN management. A final project for the Information Management course (second semester) as a Computer Science student in Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Manila.

The eSALN Application is designed to streamline the process of preparing and managing financial declarations, particularly for government officials, public servants, and individuals required to submit their Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN) as mandated by law or organizational policies. The application aims to simplify filling out the SALN form, perform accurate calculations of assets, liabilities, and net worth, and maintain an organized database of users' financial records. It caters to users with varying technical expertise, ensuring ease of use and accessibility for both technical and non-technical individuals.

As the eSALN Application evolves, its developers prioritize the implementation of database backups to safeguard against data loss hence, for the regular monitoring of the system to identify and address any potential security vulnerabilities. Future versions may include a sign out feature and further updates to improve the user interface, enhance data processing capabilities, and introduce new functionalities based on user feedback and changing regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the eSALN Application places a high priority on data security and privacy. 

It incorporates robust security measures, including access controls that restrict user access to specific information and user authentication
to prevent unauthorized entry. Moreover, the application adheres strictly to privacyregulations, ensuring that users' financial data remains confidential and is not shared with unauthorized parties.
